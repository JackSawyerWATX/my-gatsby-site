I am torn between reality and my own hopes and dreams, such as I'm sure many of us are, that there are things I wish more than anything I could give and that I wouldn't need money or any compensation for. That I would have the means to create things for other people that wouldn't need any afterthought like if I can afford to do something, or if I have the time to dedicate to something or someone in need. Again, I wouldn't believe I am alone in this thought.

The art of it comes in the balance of what my abilities are. Do I have the time to dedicate this something? Do I have the finiancial means to give something away? Do I have the ability to make whatever it is that I see a need for or that I know someone needs, even if they don't express to anyone that they need it?

The most important question I have to process is is what I want to do something that will better the life or lives of the people I am amking this for, or is this something I need to build my ego so that I cvan have a pat on the back and someone can tell me "you did a great job?" This conflict in the search for my intentions for doing the right thing can often combat the acceptance of a simple, heartfelt statement of gratitude. It seems easier to leave something at someone's doorstep and run away only to watch from far away the look on their faces, hoping it belongs to something in the realm of unexpected and plesant delight. This only buffers the shame that I may feel if it is accepted with the opposite feelings, or worse, rejected completely and left outside.

Maybe the gratitude is the assurance that the right thing was made, and the ingratitude would be a sign of who really wants my help. I feel my gist should be revisable if need be. How can I make it better for that person. Say if it were food that someone was allergic to, my intention would still exist to want to feed that person, so why not remake somethjing for them to enjoy?

Giving should never expect anything in return.
