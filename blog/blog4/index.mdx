I used to be of the mindset that I could accomplish anything. I called it my Superman complex. Now I have reached a place in life where that is not possible. I have to rely on friends and family to help me with all kinds of things. I go to these people when I am overwhelmed or stressed and talk about things that are going on. I find solace and solutions in asking for the opinions of those around me. More importantly, I have chosen to surround myself with people who are wiser than I am, have more experience than I do, and have a closer relationship with whomever they consider to be their higher power. I don't close myself off to people of one religion or belief, and I find that we are all after the same things no matter what religion we find ourselves relating to the most. I don't mind if you disagree with my point of view on that. I have discovered the value of surrounding myself with great people, with people I look up to, and with people I can help. I have received no greater gift than gifts that I can and have shared with others.
