I recently lost my mother and I am dealing with grief on a level that I've never understood before. My mother and I never had a solid relationship and didn't see eye to eye on many things, but in the last year of her life, we started to build a relationship where we understood our differences more than in any previous year of my life. That is where I feel truly blessed, and while it is hard losing a mother for anyone, this has been a time of discovery to find answers to things I have been curious about my entire life and just did not know how to ask these questions. Family has been more than helpful with answers, clearing up many misconceptions and misunderstandings, and this has rebuilt my relationships with family members I haven't talked to in years. My conclusion is, that with a vast void in my heart where I once had a mother I could call and talk to any time I needed, there has been a trajectory of growth from this that I have needed for many years.
