I used to drink pretty heavily. I did drugs too, but I'm sober and have been for a few years. Although something in life usually happens that makes me question it for a short moment. I'll ask myself if I would do well if I had one pint of Guinness, or a glass of whiskey, or smoke one joint. When I look at my past behavior with alcohol and cannabis, it tends to spiral out of control fast and I quickly start to depend on that instead of taking problems head on and working toward a resolution. The cowardice of hiding behind an altered state is gone. The desire to move quickly past a problem by doing the next right thing and talking about it, asking for help, and doing what I can to move forward every day has become my standard operating procedure. This is scratching the surface of many years of recovery, and I tend to dig into this more so in this blog explaining various experiences and solutions I have found.
